/**
 * Removes duplicate (galleryid, filename) rows from the pictures table, keeping the lowest
 * pid of each group. Required before adding a UNIQUE KEY on those columns, since ALTER TABLE
 * ADD UNIQUE INDEX fails on a table that already contains duplicates.
 *
 * Runs once per site on success, and is attempted at most twice in total. The key
 * this prepares for is now only created on a table the request just created (see
 * nggallery_record_missing_pictures_guard() for why an existing table is not migrated), so the
 * key-existence exit below can no longer be relied on to stop the work repeating -- on an
 * existing table it would never be satisfied, and the ADD INDEX, self-join DELETE and DROP INDEX
 * would re-run on every version bump and module-list change forever. What bounds it now is
 * ngg_pictures_dedupe_done on success plus a recorded attempt count on failure: a pass that
 * failed or whose request was killed mid-DELETE leaves the duplicate rows #781 created *and*
 * ngg_dedupe_tmp_idx behind, and nothing short of uninstall clears the done marker, so marking
 * done before the work would strand both permanently. One retry recovers an interrupted pass
 * (the leftover-index branch below is what makes a second pass viable) while still being
 * bounded, so a table that reliably fails cannot re-run the scan forever.
 *
 * The attempt is counted before the first statement that can fail, not somewhere in the middle.
 * Counting it after the ADD INDEX left the one branch that fails durably -- a restricted ALTER
 * grant, a read-only replica, a drop-in that does not implement the statement (#969) -- outside
 * the bound entirely, so on exactly those tables the failing ALTER and its two information_schema
 * lookups re-ran on every pass forever: the unbounded shape #935 closed, narrowed rather than
 * removed. Everything past that point is idempotent, so paying one attempt for a transient
 * failure is the cheaper mistake.
 *
 * It still runs, rather than being dropped with the migration, because removing the duplicate
 * rows #781's Scan Folder race created is worth doing on its own -- those rows are what a site
 * owner actually sees -- and 4.4.0/4.4.1 were already doing it. What is deferred to #941 is the
 * UNIQUE KEY, not the cleanup.

	// ngg_pictures_guard_deferred so #941 can size and target it. Existing tables that already
	// carry the full-length key are untouched either way: dbDelta() never drops an index, and it
